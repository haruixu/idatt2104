# idatt2104 - nettverksprogrammering
___
The repository acts as a hub for my code assignments in this course. It served as a valuable lesson for learning rust. The course is intended to be solved in java or c++, but the teachers told us that we were free to choose a language of our desire, as long as it was not python. One of their suggestions was rust. 
It seemed like a good opportunity to force me into coding rust, as I had been looking for a valid excuse to do so for some time. Overall, this was a fun little project which solidified my passion for rust.
